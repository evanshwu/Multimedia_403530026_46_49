#Multimedia Java Calculator
######**What is this?**
This is the first project for the course Multimedia Spring 2016.

#About the calculator
######**Language?**
We used **Java**.

######**How it works?**
It's actually hard to explain it using only words, I will post a pdf file to explain it.Hope it's easier to understand.

######**<font color="red">How to run the program</font>**
There should be three things:

-Calculator.rar<br>
-Calculator.zip <br>
-src/Test.java<br>

To make things easier, I've made an exe file to run the caluculator, thumbs up for *Launch4j*! The src folder contains the source code, but the zip file contains the whole file you need to import into Eclipse. Some of you guys may afraid the exe file contains virus, so I recommend you to go [here][eclipse] and download Eclipse to run the program.
